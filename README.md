## 📁 Projects Included 📊

### 🔹 1. Loan Prediction

- **Notebook**: `LoanPrediction.ipynb`
- **Algorithm**: Logistic Regression
- **Description**: Predicts whether a loan will be approved based on factors like income, credit history, property area, etc.
- **Target Variable**: `Loan_Status` (Yes/No)

---

### 🔹 2. House Price Prediction

- **Notebook**: `House Price Prediction.ipynb`
- **Algorithm**: Linear Regression
- **Description**: Predicts house prices based on input features such as square footage, number of bedrooms, bathrooms, etc.
- **Target Variable**: `Price` (continuous value)

---

### 🔹 3. Diabetes Prediction

- **Notebook**: `Diabetes Prediction.ipynb`
- **Algorithm**: Logistic Regression
- **Description**: Predicts whether a person is diabetic or not based on health indicators like glucose level, BMI, and age.
- **Target Variable**: `Outcome` (1 = Diabetic, 0 = Not)

---

### 🔹 4. SONAR Rock vs Mine Classification

- **Notebook**: `SONAR Rock vs Mine Prediction.ipynb`
- **Algorithm**: Support Vector Machine
- **Description**: Classifies sonar signals as either rock or mine based on 60 frequency-based features.
- **Target Variable**: `Label` (R = Rock, M = Mine)
